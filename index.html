    <br>
    Hey there! Thanks for stopping by! <br><br>
    My name is Shayaan. I was born in Pakistan üáµüá∞, moved to the Bay Area 
    üåâ when I was 13, went to NY üóΩ to attend¬†New York University¬†and 
    got my degree in Computer Science, took a detour to LA ‚òÄÔ∏è for work and now I‚Äôm back in the bay!<br><br>
    To be completely honest, I wasn't much of a "computer person" before college. I definitely did 
    not think I was smart enough for AP Computer Science in high school. It wasn't until I took a MATLAB
    class in my freshman year of college that I realized what it is I could do with coding. Since then,
    I've taken courses ranging from Machine Learning to Game Programming, built a bunch of projects that
    you can check out <a href="#project-section">below</a>, and have taught coding to middle-schoolers and high-schoolers.  <br><br>
    I'm currently on the hunt for my first software engineering role, so if you like what you see, you 
    can reach out to me via email at <a href="mailto:shayaan96@gmail.com">shayaan96@gmail.com</a> or add me on 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shayaansaiyed/">LinkedIn</a>!<br>

      <p>I built this website to try my hand at front-end development. Using pure CSS and HTML I 
        wanted to create a simple and responsive website to showcase my coding projects.

      <h3>Predicting the happiness of a song</h3>
      <h4>2017, Machine Learning Final Project</h4>

      <br>
      <h5>What it is:</h5>
      <p>We used data from the <a href="https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.14.0/#">Spotipy API</a>
      to train a linear regression model to predict the valence (happeniness) of a song based on other features. 
      We also used K-fold cross validation to determine which features of the song were best at predicting valence</p><br>
      <h5>Tech used: </h5>
      <p>Python, Numpy, SciKit Learn</p><br>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/osermay/machine-be-learning/blob/master/ML_final_km3322_sas1122.ipynb" target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù>Github Link</a> </p>

      <h3>Grammy run</h3>
      <h4>2016, Game Programming Final Project</h4><br>
      <h5>What it is:</h5>
      <p>A 2D platform game where the user plays as Lady Gaga to collect Grammys and avoid enemies.
      </p><br>
      <h5>What I did:</h5>
      <p>I built the 2D physics engine from scratch, which meant calculating things like collisions, 
        player movement and enemy movement. I also designed the Lady Gaga meat dress sprite and the Grammy sprite.</p><br>
      <h5>Tech Used:</h5>
      <p>C++, OpenGL</p>

      <h3>Find Folks</h3>
      <h4>2016, Databases Final Project</h4><br>
      <h5>What it is:</h5>
      <p>A meetup clone where users can sign in to join groups with similar interests, add other users as friends, 
        create groups and events and sign up for upcoming events. </p><br>
      <h5>What I did:</h5>
      <p>I worked on the functionality to create events, search for events, and create groups </p><br>
      <h5>Tech Used:</h5>
      <p>Python, Flask, MySQL DB, HTML/CSS</p><br>

      <h3>SpaceBABY</h3>
      <h4>2016, HackHarvard Submission</h4><br>
      <h5>What it is:</h5>
      <p>SpaceBaby is a rudimentary scale model of the Solar System that my team and 
        I built over the weekend at HackHarvard.</p><br>
      <h5>What I did:</h5>
      <p>My contribution was programming the movement of the planets based on Kepler‚Äôs Laws. 
        I was also in charge of learning the Babylon.js library and teaching it to my teammates. 
        It was my first time developing with Javascript, which added created more of a challenge. 
      </p><br>
      <h5>Tech Used:</h5>
      <p>JavaScript, Babylon.js library</p><br>
      <p>Head on over to <a href="https://devpost.com/software/spacebaby">Devpost</a> to learn more or to 
        <a href="https://github.com/ng1355/spacebaby">Github</a> to see the source code</p>
